Crawler

Customized web crawler for scraping data from websites using python. Web crawler is a program which automatically retrives web pages and parse those pages to extract some other links and it continues until retriving every page in website.

This can be used for custom purposes like downloading specific data from website, testing website for bugs (like sql injection ,XSS etc), load testing on website, unreachable pages, finding slow loading pages and more. We can customize this web crawler as our needs. So I am doing for my pentesting on web applications but it can be extended to other purposes.
